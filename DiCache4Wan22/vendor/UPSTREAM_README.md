<div align="left">

> Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for multi-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope with diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present **DiCache**, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) _Online Probe Profiling Scheme_ leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly indicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically customize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) _Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment_ adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step historical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art approaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo and Flux.

DiCache consists of _Online Probe Profiling Strategy_ and _Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment_. The former dynamically determines the caching timing with an online shallow-layer probe at runtime, while the latter combines multi-step caches based on the probe feature trajectory to adaptively approximate the feature at the current timestep. By integrating the above two techniques, DiCache answers "when" and "how" to cache for diffusion models within a unified framework.
